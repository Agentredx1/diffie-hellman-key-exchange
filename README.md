#Diffie-Hellman Key exchange example
This was the first time using javascript with HTML <br />
Meant as an exercise to understand and display how the diffie hellman key exchange works <br />

Notes:
 - rewrite using objects, more accurate representation of public/private domains with scope
 - Stick with list of associated P & G values, generating these is it's own project.
